## Processing

Most of these Shapefiles have been processed to fit ærialbot's needs, which are

1. that they contain a single layer
2. with a single record
3. of type `POLYGON`
4. whose points are notated as longitude-latitude pairs (CRS: `+proj=longlat`).

In order to coerce the original versions of the shapefiles (which are kept in `orig/` subdirectories just in case future changes are required) to match these conventions, the excellent [mapshaper web interface](https://mapshaper.org) was used as follows.

1. Upload all relevant files (`.dbf`, `.prj`, `.shp`, and `.shx`).
2. Simplify to desired level (depends on input granularity, often around 10%) with visual slider tool – on the [command line](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference), this could be achieved via the `-simplify` flag.
3. If polygon overlaps are present: `mapshaper -clean`.
4. Fix projection if required (run `mapshaper info` to check) via `mapshaper -proj crs=wgs84 target=LAYER_NAME` (the important bit is `+proj=longlat`, which is implied by `wgs84`).
5. If it's a polyline (run `mapshaper info` to check): `mapshaper -polygon`.
6. Optionally: Remove features/regions you don't want (like Antarctica or large bodies of water, for example) via the visual tools.
7. Turn all features/states/provinces/counties into a single feature: `mapshaper -dissolve`.
8. Export.

Some useful exploration steps using `pyshp` in the Python REPL:

```python
>>> import shapefile
>>> shapes = sf.shapes()
>>> len(shapes)
1
>>> sf.shapeTypeName
'POLYGON'
>>> shapes[0].shapeTypeName
'POLYGON'
>>> len(shapes[0].points)
30901
```
